## Develop Proficiency in Performing Code Reviews

- Regularly performs code reviews and gives peers relevant and useful comments with a focus on:
    - Maintaining the code style of the project.
    - Efficiency and performance of the package.
- Comments given to peers are constructive, and any suggestions for changes are paired with documentation or examples or examples where the suggestion has already been implemented.

## Communication

- Maintains readable documentation (for developers and less technically experienced users) to ensure the project is scalable, and makes the software usable for new users.
- Continously contributes to discussion during in-person meetings
- Provides context to code changes/implementations in Pull Requests

## Developing a Node Package

- Develop a node package that is meant to be used by students.
    - Follows the universal design principle to allow for ease of use for students.

## Testing

- Implementing testing for all backend features to ensure the correctness of all pushed code.
    - Test cases should have purpose and should not only exist for code coverage
