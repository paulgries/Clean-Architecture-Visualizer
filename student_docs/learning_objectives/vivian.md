# Learning objectives

## 1. Develop comprehensive full-stack engineering proficiency

Develop a holistic understanding of software architecture by actively contributing to both server-side logic and client-side interfaces, ensuring seamless integration between data management and user interaction layers.

## 2. Master high-fidelity prototyping and design tooling

Acquire proficiency in Figma to create detailed UI mockups and prototypes, serving as a visual blueprint to align development efforts and validate design concepts before implementation.

## 3. Standardize collaborative development and review workflows

Establish good code review standards by submitting feature Pull Requests that utilize detailed templates—including technical summaries, test plans, and visual evidence—to streamline the review process and reduce ambiguity for peers.

## 4. Implement an iterative stakeholder feedback loop

Translate user needs into technical requirements by conducting structured client or user feedback sessions, systematically documenting insights, and ensuring those insights directly influence subsequent engineering tasks and code iterations.

## 5. Write technical documentation

Ensure long-term project maintainability by generating clear, comprehensive documentation for architectural decisions and code logic, facilitating future scalability and seamless knowledge transfer within the team.
