# Learning Objectives

## Gain fullstack development experience

This learning objective, as it pertains to this project, involves gaining first-hand experience of developing a package that meets the functional specifications as decided upon by the group and the teaching team.

This can be measured through:

- individual contributions that lead to the delivery of aforementioned functionality
- delivery of the MVP

## Gain experience in setting up testing infrastructure

This learning objective involves writing some tests to ensure functionality remains reliable across the project and enabling automation within the project.

This can be measured through:

- individual contributions that lead to the delivery of aforementioned functionality
- delivery of the MVP

## Demonstrate excellence in communicating technical concepts

This learning objective will be illustrated through:

- writing high-quality pull requests that includes
  - what has changed
  - why the changes are relevant
  - testing instructions (when applicable)
  - adherance to the agreed upon PR template
- documentation of code

This can be measured through:

- viewing PRs across the entire semester
- within each PRs, examining both the content of the PR as well as the comments provided in the code

## Managing Time and Workload Effectively

This learning objective consists of making realistic expectations on what work is to be done on a week-to-week basis and remaining accountable to that work load. There is a caveat here that some weeks there will be less work to be completed than others.

This can be measured through:

- weekly journal reflections
- comparing weekly git contributions to the average git contributions

## Learn how to apply Clean Architecture outside of CSC207

This learning objective involves taking the concepts taught in CSC207 Software Development on Clean Architecture and applying them to a new project.

This can be measured through:

- adherence of the Clean Architecture structure
- PRs of use cases that adhere to the required structure
