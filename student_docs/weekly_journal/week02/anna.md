# Learning objectives

## 1. Advance responsive front-end development using modern frameworks

    I attempted to make the Figma prototype responsive, but as I was also learning how to effectively use Figma itself, it was far too time consuming and I abandoned the effort. 

## 2. Strengthen CSS and visual design decision-making
    This week I tried to consider good design and layout in the Figma prototype. I referenced standard web layouts and kept colour cohesion and contrast in mind while designing the prototype. Sketching the design I had in my head on my iPad first was helpful to figure out the layout and think through interactions without the burden of new software (Figma). I did not sketch up my design for the code viewing portion, and that lead to miscommunications with Vivian about what I thought that part of the Figma would look like. 

    Below is a pdf with the first sketch of the design, and that can be compared to the first Figma prototype here:

## 3. Learn to design and implement automated GUI tests

## 4. Use Figma more efficiently for interactive design and iteration

    Before starting work on the prototype, I spent an hour watching Figma tutorials and kept a document of the videos I had watched, and some keyboard shortcuts shown in the video. I also googled how to do things as I went to try and do things more efficiently. 
    It took quite a while to figure out how to position things the way I wanted, but it wasn't too challenging to setup the interactions between frames since I learned that for CSC318. I struggled with auto-layout, but got a decent grasp on how to use components. Learning how to use the grid guidelines made designing much easier. On the next prototype I hope to re-evaluate the use of variables and further build on components to make the workflow more efficient now that I know the basics.

## 5: Efficient meeting preparation and participation
    To prepare for the student's meeting, I had thought of some issues to discuss mentally, but did not write them out or particularly devote time to preparing for the meeting as I had hoped. The meeting itself was focused, so my lack of preparation wasn't a hinderance. 
    I had a later meeting with Vivian to discuss the design and flow of the prototype and split up responsibilites. 
    Overall in all meetings I took good enough notes that I was not confused about anything that was required of me after that meeting.

## 6: Sustainable time management across courses

    This week I spent a lot of time learning how to use Figma and making the prototype. I spent 13 hours working on the course, which is more than I would have liked, and I did not achieve my goal of keeping the workload proportional to my other courses. 
    I used my planner reasonably well to keep track of tasks, but they lacked specificity. I did achieve what I wanted to achieve for the week, and in retrospect it would have been difficult to further break up my tasks, because in the case of making a prototype, I wasn't exactly sure what would be involved and I worked well figuring it out as I went.
