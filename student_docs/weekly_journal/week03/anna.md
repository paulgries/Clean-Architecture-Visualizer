# Learning objectives

## 1. Advance responsive front-end development using modern frameworks
N/A

## 2. Strengthen CSS and visual design decision-making

With the chance to improve on the prototype in Figma, I was able to make the CA diagram main page look a lot nicer by introducing a header where the controls could sit. I also added the home button we had elsewhere on the site to make navigation more consistent. This header can be used on more of the screens to maintain cohesion throughout the site. 

## 3. Learn to design and implement automated GUI tests
N/A

## 4. Use Figma more efficiently for interactive design and iteration

I have been more efficient with using Figma since I know how to use the program better now. The most challenging part of this redesign was the repetitive duplicating and reforming for learning mode, as I could not modify components I had taken from another library all together. 
It was also a challenge that the layout for the CA diagram views was not made as a component, so I was only able to redesign one screen for the sake of time.
One new thing I learned this week was how to scale an entire selection of things uniformly together, which I previously was not able to figure out. I also made better use of the keyboard shortcuts I learned. 

## 5: Efficient meeting preparation and participation

I devoted a few minutes before all my meetings this week to plan what should be discussed. 

This link should update with my notes as I write them on my iPad.

## 6: Sustainable time management across courses

Since I spent more time than I wanted on this course last week, I set out to be less ambitious this week, and I did manage to keep my time to 8-10 hours. 

My goals for this week were:
- [ ] Write Week 2 learning journal
- [ ] Meet with Vivian to split up Figma work
- [ ] Update the Figma Prototype based on feedback (Below my tasks only)
  - [ ] Redesign the Learning Mode screen
  - [ ] Add a progress bar to show the metrics
  - [ ] Add more bad use cases
- [ ] Determine what Figma skills Paul could teach us
- [ ] Brainstorm use cases for how students use our project

Vivian and I decided that, as we were nearing the end of our time with Figma, a tutorial was less useful and have mostly been able to google our questions.

Creating more bad use cases has been pushed to next week, since we ran out of time after redesigning other screens. 
We were undecided on whether the progress bar would be necessary and what it should actually represent, so it did not get added.
