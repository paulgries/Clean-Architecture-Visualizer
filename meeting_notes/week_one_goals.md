## CSC494 Week 1 Goals

1. Find out what students want...
    - How can this tool help students learn Clean Architecture
    - As a student what were the major roadblocks in understanding Clean Architecture
2. Find pre-existing repositories that are using Clean Architecture and take note of their tech stacks.
3. Make a list of Learning Goals for our CSC494/495
4. Think about how AI can be used in the development in this project.
5. Test different models to see how they solve/generate solutions to these use cases (this is a long-term goal to be considered once the project is in development).
